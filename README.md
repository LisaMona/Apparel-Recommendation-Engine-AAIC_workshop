# Apparel-Recommendation-Engine-AAIC_workshop

This work is done as a part of a workshop by Applied AI Course on Apparel Recommendation Engine.
The data has been taken from Amazon.com in a policy compliant manner. Visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSECommerceService/latest/DG/Welcome.html for more information.

About 183K datapoints(product details) were provided, but it was reduced after data cleaning and pre-processing.
Originally extracted with 19 features of products, only 7 have been considered as a part of this work in order to reduce complexity as well as duration.

The .json file exceeded the size limit, hence couldn't be uploaded. However the image files and other folders are present in the repository.
